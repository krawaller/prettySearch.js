        <h1>prettySearch.js</h1>
        <p>This is a bookmarklet for iOS devices which lets you search the current page using a search string or a Regular Expression. It highlights the matches and lets you jump between them, and the bar follows you around the page. Also, the search is carried out asynchronously, so your browser won't freeze. On top of this, it uses a new nifty caching system to work instantenously, even when offline, yet it is automatically updated whenever a new version is released.</p>
		<p>Curious? Feel free to have a look at the source code repository <a href="http://github.com/krawaller/prettySearch.js">here</a></p>
        
        <h2>Demo</h2>
        <p>Just tap the link at the bottom of the install section to try prettySearching on this page. Warning - Safari and Chrome has an overzealous security feature that might prevent this, so you'd better save it and test it on another page.</p>
        
        <h2>Install</h2>
        <p>If you're on a desktop computer whose bookmarks you're syncing to your iOS device, you can just drag the link below to your bookmark bar and perform a sync.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, you'll have to get somewhat dirty. Bookmark this page on your iOS device. When it's saved, go in to your bookmarks list and edit the address. It will be quite long, since we've appended the bookmarklet to it. Your mission is to delete the # and everything before it. Tap and hold on the address field and scroll to the left until you see the #. Then delete everything before it. Now you're good to go!</p>

				location.href += '#javascript:(function(){var%20i=document.createElement("iframe");i.src="http://79.99.1.153/prettySearch.js/cache.html.php";i.style.position="absolute";i.style.left="-1000px";window.addEventListener("message",function(e){if(e.data.substring(0,1)==";"){eval(e.data);}else{_addCss(e.data);}});document.body.appendChild(i);})()';

        <h2>Advanced</h2>
        <p>Try using a regexp like /\w+a\b/ to find all words ending in an "a". PrettySearch will look for the first subgroup, if any, so you can do stuff like /\w+ok(\w)\w+/ to make advanced searches.</p>
